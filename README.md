# Hate Speech Detection

The rise of social networks has provided users the opportunity to express their opinions freely. Unfortunately, over the years, this phenomenon has seen a rise in many expressions and comments of hatred towards other users, leading to an increase in both societal disunity and individuals affected by cyberbullying. In response to this negative trend, we exploited some approaches for building neural networks to recognize sentences, then we developed a multi-agent system, capable of making different models cooperate in order to classify an hypothetical reported comment on the social platforms as offensive, hateful or not hateful.

Before starting the program download the models from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xvYsKHCdbrDA16mpkkjPxvYWQFznTG3K/view?usp=drive_link). Then unzip the models and leave the folder into the main directory.

Install the requirements with:

  ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
